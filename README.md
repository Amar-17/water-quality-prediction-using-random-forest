# 💧 Water Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to **predict the quality of water** using sensor data and Machine Learning. The system uses the **Random Forest algorithm** to classify whether the water is safe or not based on features like **Temperature, pH, and Turbidity**.

## 📁 Project Modules

### 1. 📊 Dataset Collection
- Data collected using hardware sensors:
  - **Temperature Sensor**: Measures water temperature.
  - **pH Sensor**: Measures pH level.
  - **Light Intensity Sensor**: Measures turbidity (clarity) of water.

### 2. ⚙️ Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values
- Convert data to suitable formats
- Clean and prepare data for analysis

### 3. 📈 Data Visualization (EDA)
- Visualize data using:
  - Pie charts, Countplots, Distplots, KDE plots
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - **Pandas Profiling Report** for summary statistics

### 4. 🧠 Model Implementation
- Algorithm used: **Random Forest Classifier**
- Data split into train/test sets
- Model trained to learn water quality patterns

### 5. ✅ Classification & Prediction
- Predicts water quality based on input features
- Classifies data as **Safe** or **Not Safe**
